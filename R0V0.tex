%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code

%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.

% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to

% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}

For linear systems, the problem of design controllers with a prescribed structure is known to be NP-hard \cite{BlondelTsitsiklis1997}. Consequently, for nonlinear systems, it is \emph{at least} NP-hard.

\paragraph{Overview.} The motivation and background needed for this paper are stated in Section \ref{sec:Background and Motivation}. The problem under consideration is formalized in Section \ref{sec:Problem Formulation}. Section \ref{sec:Results} presents the result of this paper. Illustrations of the proposed approach are provided in Section \ref{sec:Illustration}. The proofs of the results are provided in Section \ref{sec:Proof of the Results}. Section \ref{sec:Conclusion} collects final remarks.

\paragraph{Notation.} Let $N\in\mathbb{N}$ be a constant value. The notation $\mathbb{N}_{[1,N]}$ stands for the set $\{i\in\mathbb{N}:1\leq i\leq N\}$. Let $c\in\mathbb{R}$ be a constant value. The notation $\mathbb{R}_{[1,c]}$ (resp. $\mathbb{R}_{\diamond c}$) stands for the set $\{x\in\mathbb{R}:1\leq x\leq c\}$ (resp.  $\{x\in\mathbb{R}:x\diamond c\}$, where $\diamond$ is a comparison operator, i.e., $\diamond\in\{<,\geq,=,\ \text{etc}\}$). A matrix $M\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ with zero elements except (possibly) those  $m_{ii},\ldots,m_{nn}$ on the diagonal is denoted as $\mathbin{\mathtt{diag}}(m_{ii},\ldots,m_{nn})$. The notation $M\succ 0$ (resp. $M\succeq 0$) stands for $M$ being positive (resp. semi) definite.

The notation $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{loc}}^\infty(\mathbb{R}_{\geq0},\mathbb{R}^m)$ stands for the class of functions $u:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}^m$ that are locally essentially bounded. Given differentiable functions $M:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ and $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n$ the notation $\partial_fM$ stands for matrix with dimension $n\times n$ and with $(i,j)$ element given by $\frac{\partial m_{ij}}{\partial x}(x)f(x)$.


\subsection{Problem Formulation and Motivation}\label{sec:Problem Formulation and Motivation}

\noindent{\itshape Class of systems.} Consider the class of systems described by the differential equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:general system}
	\dot{x}(t)=f(x(t))+B(x(t))u(t),	
\end{equation}
where, for positive times $t$, the \emph{system state} $x(t)$ and the \emph{system input variable} $u(t)$ evolve in the Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{R}^m$, respectively. The functions $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n$ and $B:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$ are assumed to be smooth, i.e., infinitely differentiable and satisfy $f(0)=0$ and $B(0)=0$. From now on the dependence of on the time $t$ will be omitted.

A function $u^\ast\in\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{loc}}^\infty(\mathbb{R}_{\geq0},\mathbb{R}^m)$ is said to be an \emph{input signal or control for \eqref{eq:general system}}. For such a control for \eqref{eq:general system}, and for every \emph{initial condition} $x^\ast$, there exists a unique solution to \eqref{eq:general system} (\cite{Teschl2012}) that is denoted by $X(t,x^\ast,u^\ast)$, when computed at time $t$. This solution is defined over an open interval $(\underline{t},\overline{t})$, and it is said to be \emph{forward complete} if $\overline{t}=+\infty$.

{\itshape Stabilizability Notion.} A forward complete solution $X^\ast(\cdot,x^\ast,u^\ast)$ to \eqref{eq:general system} is said to be  \emph{globally exponentially uniformly stabilizable} with \emph{rate} $\lambda>0$ if there exist a constant value $C>0$ and a feedback law $k^\ast:\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}\times\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$, denoted as $k^\ast(\cdot,\cdot,X^\ast,u^\ast)$, such that the inequality
\begin{equation}\label{eq:global exponential uniform stabilizability}
	\left|X(t,x^\ast,u^\ast)-X(t,x,k^\ast)\right|\leq Ce^{-\lambda t}|x^\ast-x|
\end{equation}
holds true, for every $t\geq0$, and for every $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ (\cite{Manchester2014a}). Note that this not is a particular case of \emph{incremental asymptotic stability}, the interested reader may address \cite{Forni2014,Forni2014a} for further information on this stability concept.

Note that a stronger condition than the global exponential stabilizability of a particular solution is the requirement that every forward complete solution of the system is globally exponentially stabilizable. This concept is formalized in the following definition recalled from \cite{Manchester2014a}.

\begin{definition}\label{def:US}
	The system \eqref{eq:general system} is said to be \emph{universally stabilizable} with rate $\lambda$ if there exists a static feedback law $k^\ast$ for system \eqref{eq:global exponential uniform stabilizability} that globally exponentially uniformly stabilizes any forward complete solution $X^\ast(\cdot,\cdot,u^\ast)$ to \eqref{eq:global exponential uniform stabilizability}.
\end{definition}

Note that Definition \ref{def:US} reduces to the notion of stabilizability of equilibria, when $x^\ast=0$ (for further reading on stabilizability, the reader may address \cite{Bacciotti:1992}).

For each component $i\in\mathbb{N}_{[1,m]}$ of the feedback law $k^\ast=(k_1^\ast,\ldots,k_m^\ast)^\top$, denote the set of indexes
\begin{equation*}
	\mathscr{K}(i)=\left\{j\in\mathbb{N}_{[1,n]}:k_i^\ast\ \text{depends explicitely on}\ x_j \right\}.
\end{equation*}
The definition of the set $\mathscr{K}(\cdot)$ encompasses different structures. For instance, when $m=n$ full decentralization implies that, for each index $i\in\mathbb{N}_{[1,n]}$, the component $k_i^\ast$ of the function $k^\ast$ depends only on $x_i$. This is formalized by letting $\mathscr{K}(i)=\{i\}$. Moreover, at points where $k_i^\ast$ is differentiable, the explicit dependence on $x_i$ means that, for every index $j\in\mathbb{N}_{[1,n]}$ with $j\neq i$, $\partial k_i^\ast/\partial x_j\equiv0$.

Define also the set of feedback laws
\begin{equation*}
	\Xi=\left\{k^\ast:\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}\times\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m:k_i^\ast\ \text{has the property}\ \mathscr{K}(i)\right\}.
\end{equation*}

At this point, the problem under consideration in this paper can be stated as follows.

\begin{problem}\label{problem formulation}\hfill
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Find a feedback law $k^\ast:\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}\times\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$ for system \eqref{eq:general system} that globally exponentially uniformly stabilizes any forward complete solution $X(\cdot,x^\ast,u^\ast)$ to \eqref{eq:general system};
		
		\item The function $k^\ast=(k_1^\ast,\ldots,k_m^\ast)$ belongs to the set $\Xi$.
		\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}



The property described in item 2 of Problem \ref{problem formulation} is particularly relevant for the design feedback laws with a prescribed structure (topology) for network systems rendering it universally stabilizable. Consider the network composed of systems described by the following equation.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:example system:i}
	\dot{x}_i=??
\end{equation}
Section \ref{sec:Illustration} shows how the approach proposed in this work is employed to design a decentralized controller for the network composed by interconnections of system \eqref{eq:example system:i}.

\subsection{Background}

{\itshape Riemannian metrics and differential formulation.} A Riemannian metric is a positive-definite bilinear form that depends smoothly on $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$. In a particular coordinate system, for any pair of vectors $\delta_0,\delta_1$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ the metric is defined as the inner product $\langle\delta_0,\delta_{ 1}\rangle_x=\delta_0^\top M(x)\delta_1$, where $M:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is a smooth function. Consequently, local notions of norm $|\delta_x|_x=\sqrt{\langle\delta_x,\delta_x\rangle_x}$ and orthogonality $\langle\delta_0,\delta_1\rangle_x=0$ can be defined. The metric is said to be \emph{bounded} if there exists constant values $\underline{m}>0$ and $\overline{m}>0$ such that, for every $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$, $\underline{m}I_n\leq M(x)\leq \overline{m}I_n$, where $I_n\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is the identity matrix.

Let $\Gamma(x_0,x_1)$ be the set of piecewise-smooth curves $\gamma:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}^n$ connecting $x_0=\gamma(0)$ to $x_1=\gamma(1)$. The \emph{length} and \emph{energy} of $\gamma$ are, respectively, defined by the values
\begin{equation*}
	\ell(\gamma)=\int_0^1|\gamma'(s)|_{\gamma(s)}\,ds\ \text{and}\ e(\gamma)=\int_0^1|\gamma'(s)|_{\gamma(s)}^2\,ds.
\end{equation*}
The Riemannian distance between $x_0$ and $x_1$, denoted as $\mathbin{\mathtt{dist}}(x_0,x_1)$, is defined as the curve with the smallest length connecting them. This curve is said to be a \emph{geodesic} and it is the solution to the optimization problem.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:geodesic formulation}
	\mathbin{\mathtt{dist}}(x_0,x_1)=\inf_{\gamma\in\Gamma(x_0,x_1)}\ell(\gamma).
\end{equation}

A suitable framework to deal with exponential convergence of pair of solutions to \eqref{eq:general system} is provided by the \emph{differential} (also known as variational or prolonged) dynamical system
\begin{equation}\label{eq:general system:differential}
	\dot{\delta}_x=A(x,u)\delta_x+B(x)\delta_u,
\end{equation}
where $\delta_x$ (resp. $\delta_u$) is a vector of the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ (resp. $\mathbb{R}^m$). More precisely, it is the vector tangent to a piecewise smooth curve connecting a pair of points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (resp. $\mathbb{R}^m$). The matrix $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ has components given, for every $(x,u)\in\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^m$, by $A_{jk}(x,u)=\tfrac{\partial[f_j+b_ju_j]}{\partial x_k}(x,u)$
for indexes $j,k\in\mathbb{N}_{[1,n]}$. 

The resulting system composed of Equations \eqref{eq:general system} and \eqref{eq:general system:differential} is analyzed on the state space spanned by the vector $(x,\delta_x)\in\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^n$. 

Similarly to \eqref{eq:general system}, given a control $\delta_u$ for system \eqref{eq:general system:differential}, the solution to \eqref{eq:general system:differential} computed at time $t\geq0$ with $(x,u)\in\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^n$ and issuing from the  initial condition $\delta_x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ is denoted by $\Delta_x(t,x,\delta_x,u,\delta_u)$. 

Lyapunov stability notions of solutions to \eqref{eq:general system:differential} are similar to those of linear parameter-varying systems (LPVS) (see \cite[Ch. 2 and 3]{Briat2015} for more information on LPVS). 

The importance of the stability of \eqref{eq:general system:differential} for system \eqref{eq:general system} can be understood as follows. Given fixed controls $u$ and $\delta u$ for systems \eqref{eq:general system} and \eqref{eq:general system:differential}, respectively. If every solution $|\Delta_x(t,x,\delta_x,u,\delta u)|\to0$ exponentially as $t\to\infty$, then every pair of solutions to \eqref{eq:general system} converge to each other exponentially. The interested reader may address \cite{Lohmiller1998,Sontag2010} and references therein for further details.

A sufficient condition for the stability of \eqref{eq:general system:differential} is provided by analyzing the derivative of a particular function along the solutions of systems \eqref{eq:general system} and \eqref{eq:general system:differential}. This function is recalled from \cite{Forni2014} and \cite{Manchester2014a}.

\begin{definition}\label{def:}
		 A smooth function $V:\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}$ is said to be a \emph{metric for system \eqref{eq:general system}} if there exist constant values $\underline{c}>$ and $\overline{c}>$ such that the inequality
		 \begin{subequations}\label{eq:metric}
		 \begin{equation}
		 	\underline{c}|\delta_x|^2\leq V(x,\delta_x)\leq \overline{c}|\delta_x|^2,
	 	 \end{equation}
	 	 holds, for every $(x,\delta_x)\in\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^n$. Given fixed controls $u$ and $\delta u$ for systems \eqref{eq:general system} and \eqref{eq:general system:differential}, respectively. A metric system \eqref{eq:general system} receives the adjective \emph{contraction} if there exists a value $\lambda>0$ such that the inequality
	 	 \begin{equation}
	 	 	\frac{dV}{dt}(X(t,x,u),\Delta(t,x,\delta x,u,\delta u))\leq -\lambda V(x,\delta_x)
 	 	 \end{equation}
 	 	 \end{subequations}
 	 	 holds, for every pair $(x,\delta_x)\in\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^n$.
\end{definition}
Note that a bounded Riemannian metric defined, for every $(x,\delta_x)\in\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^n$, as $V(x,\delta_x)=|\delta_x|_x^2$ and satisfying the set of inequalities \eqref{eq:metric} is a contraction metric for system \eqref{eq:general system}. With an abuse of concept, from now the bounded Riemannian metric defined above will be called simply as \emph{metric}.

The existence a contraction metric for system \eqref{eq:general system} with $u\equiv0$ implies that every two solutions of this system converge to each other exponentially. The proof of this claim can be found in \cite[Theorem 1]{Lewis1951}, and \cite[Theorems 5.7 and 5.33]{Reich2005}, and \cite[Lemma 3.3]{Isac2008}.

For the class of systems considered in this paper, the following kind of metric is of interest, since it also allows the design a feedback law for system \eqref{eq:general system:differential}.

\begin{definition}[{\cite{Manchester2014a}}]\label{def:}
	A metric for system \eqref{eq:general system} is said to be a \emph{control-contraction metric for system \eqref{eq:general system}} if there exists a constant value $\lambda>0$ such that the condition
	\begin{subequations}\label{eq:Arstein-Sontag}
		\begin{equation}\label{eq:}
			\delta_x^\top M(x)B(x)=0
		\end{equation}
		implies that the inequality
		\begin{align}
			\delta_x^\top(\dot{M}+A^\top M+MA)\delta_x\leq\ -2\lambda \delta_x^\top M\delta_x\label{eq:}
		\end{align}
		holds, where $\dot{M}:=\partial_{f+Bu}M$.
	\end{subequations}
\end{definition}
The set of equations \eqref{eq:Arstein-Sontag} is an adaptation of Artstein-Sontag's condition for contraction. Given a control-contraction metric for system \eqref{eq:general system}, Finsler's lemma (cf. \cite[Lemma 11.1]{CalafioreGhaoui2014}) provides stabilizing a feedback law of the form $\delta_u=K\delta_x$ for system \eqref{eq:general system:differential} defined for every $\delta_x\in\mathbb{R}^n$, where $K:\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^m\to\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}$. 

The following result is recalled from \cite{Manchester2014a} and provides a feedback law for system \eqref{eq:general system} given a feedback law for system \eqref{eq:general system:differential}.

\begin{theorem}\label{prop:CCM Existence}
	If there exists a control-contraction metric for system \eqref{eq:general system}, then there exists a solution to item 1 of Problem~\ref{problem formulation}.
\end{theorem}

Another important result of Theorem \ref{prop:CCM Existence} the feedback for system \eqref{eq:general system} obtained by integrating a feedback law designed for system \eqref{eq:general system:differential}.

As remarked in \cite{Manchester2014a}, the main advantage to look for control-contraction metric with respect to a control-Lyapunov function is that the former case can be formulate in terms of a convex optimization problem \cite{Rantzer:2001}. The steps to obtain a control to system \eqref{eq:general system} that solves item 1 of Problem~\ref{problem formulation} are shown below.

Step 1 (Offline LMI computation). Consider the change of variables $\eta=M\delta$ and define the matrix $W=M^{-1}$. The set of equations \eqref{eq:Arstein-Sontag} is equivalent (cf. \cite[Lemma 11.1]{CalafioreGhaoui2014}) to the existence of a bounded differentiable function $W:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ such that $W=W^\top\succ0$ and a function $Y:\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^m\to\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ satisfying the following linear matrix inequality (LMI)
\begin{equation}\label{eq:LMI formulation}
	-\dot{W}+AW+WA^\top+BY+(BY)^\top+2\lambda W\preceq0,
\end{equation}
for every $(x,u)\in\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^m$. Consequently, $M=W^{-1}$ is a control-contraction metric for system \eqref{eq:general system}.

Step 2 (Online controller integration). The feedback law for system \eqref{eq:general system} can be obtained by integration as follows. Let $u^\ast:\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}\to\mathbb{R}^m$ be a control for system \eqref{eq:general system} and $K=YW^{-1}$, from Hopf-Rinow theorem (cf. \cite[Theorem 7.7]{Boothby1986}), for every $x_0$ and $x_1\in\mathbb{R}^n$, there exist a smooth geodesic curve $\gamma:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}^n$ connecting them. This implies that the solution $k^\ast$ to the integral equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:contracting feedback law}
	k^\ast(t,s)=u^\ast(t)+\int_0^s K(\gamma(\sigma),k^\ast(t,\sigma))\gamma'(\sigma)\,d\sigma,
\end{equation}
where $s\in[0,1]$, is a feedback law for system \eqref{eq:general system}.

{\itshape Motivation.} From the above steps, even if the problem of imposing a particular structure on $Y$ to correspond to the constraints of Problem \ref{problem formulation} was tractable, the integration of the controller would not necessarily satisfy these constraints. This is due to the fact that the solutions to the optimization problem \eqref{eq:geodesic formulation} can not be distributely computed.

{\itshape Contribution.} In this paper, these limitations are addressed by imposing a block-diagonal structure over $W$. Moreover, when $W$ is row-diagonal dominant, not only the solutions to the optimization problem \eqref{eq:geodesic formulation} can be computed in parallel but also the LMI \eqref{eq:contracting feedback law}.

\section{Results}\label{sec:Results}

\begin{definition}\label{def:SSCCM}
	A control-contraction metric $V$ for system \eqref{eq:general system} receives the adjective \emph{sum-separable} if $M$ has a block-diagonal structure. 
\end{definition}

Definition~\ref{def:SSCCM} implies that there exist integers $N>1$ and $n_i>0$ such that $n_1+\ldots+n_N=n$. Also, there exist smooth bounded functions $M_i:\mathbb{R}^{n_i}\to\mathbb{R}^{n_i\times n_i}$ satisfying $M_i=M_i^\top\succ0$, for every index $i\in\mathbb{N}_{[1,N]}$, and the equation
	\begin{equation*}
		V(x,\delta_x)=\sum_{i=1}^N \delta_{x_i}^\top M_i(x_i)\delta_{x_i},
	\end{equation*}
for every $(x_i,\delta x_i)\in\mathbb{R}^{n_i}\times\mathbb{R}^{n_i}$.

Although the requirement of a control-contraction metric $M$ to have block-diagonal structure may be restrictive, for positive linear time-invariant systems the existence of a matrices $P=P^\top\succ0$ with diagonal structure is not conservative \cite{Tanaka2011}. Thus, the question of how restrictive is the requirement of $M$ to be diagonal is open. The main result of the paper is stated below.

\todo[inline]{Compare SS-CCM with SS-LF from \cite{Dirr2015,Rantzer2013}}

To solve item 2 of Problem~\ref{problem formulation}, the structure on the feedback defined in Equation \eqref{eq:contracting feedback law} is obtained by imposing a a suitable constraint on the function $Y$ to be satisfied together with the LMI \eqref{eq:LMI formulation}. 

For each index $i\in\mathbb{N}_{[1,N]}$, define the sets 
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{equation*}
		\mathscr{K}_Y(i)=\{j\in \mathbb{N}_{[1,N]}\setminus\mathscr{K}(i):Y_{ij}\equiv0\}
	\end{equation*}
	and
	\begin{align*}
		\Xi_Y=\{Y:\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^m\to\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}:\text{the}\ i\text{-th row}\ Y_i\ \\
		\text{has the property}&\ \mathscr{K}_Y(i)\}.
	\end{align*}
\end{subequations}
Note that the set $\mathscr{K}_Y(i)$ is the set index for which the corresponding columns of the row-vector $Y_i$ are zero. By definition, this set is the complement of $\mathscr{K}(i)$. Consequently, given an index $j\in\mathscr{K}_Y$ and $W$ is diagonal, the $i$-th line of the vector $YW^{-1}\delta_x$ does not depend on $j$-th component of the vector $\delta_x$. As remarked in \cite{Tanaka2011}, the constraint ``$Y\in\Xi_Y$'' is linear.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:main result}
	If there exist a smooth functions $W:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ and $Y:\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^m\to\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ such that, for every $(x,\delta x,u)\in\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^m$, $W=W^\top\succ0$, $W$ is block-diagonal $Y\in\Xi_Y$ and the pair $(W,Y)$ is a solution to the LMI \eqref{eq:LMI formulation}, then there exists a solution to Problem~\ref{problem formulation}.
\end{theorem}

The detailed proof of Theorem \ref{thm:main result} is provided in Section \ref{sec:Proof of the Results}. 

Although Theorem \ref{thm:main result} provides a methodology to design distributed controllers, \emph{a priori} the computation of the LMI \eqref{eq:LMI formulation} is cannot be done in parallel. The next result provides sufficient conditions to solve each component \eqref{eq:LMI formulation} independently, and according to the structure defined by the set $\Xi$. Before present it, the following concept of block-diagonally dominant matrix is recalled from \cite{ZhangLiChen2006}.

Consider the smooth function $T:\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^m\to\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ with elements $i,j\in\mathbb{N}_{[1,N]}$ defined as
	\begin{subequations}\label{eq:T}
	\begin{align}
		T_{ii}=-\dot{W}_i+A_{ii}W_i+W_iA_i^\top+B_iY_{ii}+(B_iY_{ii})^\top\nonumber\\
		+2\lambda_i W_i
	\end{align}
	and
	\begin{equation}
		T_{ij}=A_{ij}W_j+W_iA_{ji}+B_iY_{ij}+(B_jY_{ji})^\top.
	\end{equation}
	\end{subequations}

\begin{definition}\label{def:}
	The matrix $T$ is said to be \emph{block-diagonally dominant} if the inequality
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:BDD}
		|T_{ii}^{-1}|^{-1}\geq\sum_{\substack{j=1\\ j\neq i}}^N|T_{ij}|,
	\end{equation}
	holds, for every index $i\in\mathbb{N}_{[1,N]}$ and for every $(x,u)\in\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^m$.
\end{definition}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:distributed computation}
	 If there exist a smooth functions $W:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ and $Y:\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^m\to\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ such that, for every $(x,\delta x,u)\in\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^m$, $W=W^\top\succ0$, $W$ is block-diagonal $Y\in\Xi_Y$ and the pair $(W,Y)$ is a solution to the LMI
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:LMI formulation:i}
		T_{ii}\preceq 0
	\end{equation}
	for every index $i\in\mathbb{N}_{[1,N]}$, and the matrix $T$ is diagonally dominant, then pair of matrices $W$ and $Y$ is a solution to the LMI \eqref{eq:LMI formulation}.
\end{corollary}

The detailed proof of Corollary \ref{cor:distributed computation} is provided in Section \ref{sec:Proof of the Results}.

\section{Illustration}\label{sec:Illustration}

Let $N>0$ be a constant integer, for each index $i\in\mathbb{N}_{[1,N]}$, consider the system given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:example}
	\left\{\begin{array}{rcl}
		\dot{x}_i&=&-x_i-x_i^3+y_i^2 + 0.01\left(x_{i-1}^3 - 2x_i^3 +x_{i+1}^3\right)\\
		\dot{y}_i&=&u_i,
	\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
where for convenience $x_0=x_1$ and $x_N=x_{N+1}$.

For each index $i\in\mathbb{N}_{[1,N]}$, define the vectors $q_i=(x_i,y_i)$, $\breve{q}_i=(x_{i-1},x_{i+1})$ and let $q=(q_1,\ldots,q_N)$. Denote also
\begin{align*}
	f_i(q_i,\breve{q}_i)=&\begin{bmatrix}
		-x_i-x_i^3+y_i^2 + 0.01\left(x_{i-1}^3 - 2x_i^3 +x_{i+1}^3\right)\\
		0
	\end{bmatrix}\\
	B_i=&\begin{bmatrix}
	0\\ 1
	\end{bmatrix}.
\end{align*}

Note that system \eqref{eq:example} is not feedback linearizable in the sense of \cite{Isidori:1995}, because the vector fields
\begin{align*}
	B=&\mathbin{\mathtt{diag}}(B_1,\ldots,B_N),\\
	\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial q}B-\dfrac{\partial B}{\partial q}f=&\mathbin{\mathtt{diag}}\left(\begin{bmatrix}
	2y_1\\0
	\end{bmatrix},\ldots,\begin{bmatrix}
	2y_N\\0
	\end{bmatrix}\right)
\end{align*}
are not linearly independent when $y_1=\cdots=y_N=0$.  Furthermore, due to the quadratic term on $y$, the only action of the controller on the $x$-subsystem is capable of is to move the $x$-component of solution to \eqref{eq:example} towards the positive semi-axis. In other words, the controller cannot reduce the value of the $x$-component.

Employing the method provided in Theorem~\ref{thm:main result}, the LMI \eqref{eq:LMI formulation} has been solved with optimization parser Yalmip \cite{Loefberg2004,Loefberg2009} and the solver Mosek for a network composed of four systems (i.e., $N=4$) and for three different constraints on the matrix $Y$.

In all cases, the matrix $W$ has a diagonal structure as follows
\begin{equation*}
 W=\mathbin{\mathtt{diag}}\left(W_a,W_b,W_b,W_a\right),
\end{equation*}
the definition of the matrices $W_a$ and $W_b$ differs, according to each case considered.

In the first one, no constraints were imposed on the matrix $Y$. The parser took 97 seconds to solve the  LMI \eqref{eq:LMI formulation}. The components of the matrix $W$ and the matrix $Y$ that form a solution to the \eqref{eq:LMI formulation} are
\begin{equation*}
		W_a=\mathbin{\mathtt{diag}}\left(
 1.27,1.53\right),\quad W_b=\mathbin{\mathtt{diag}}\left(1.08,1.53\right)
\end{equation*}
and the matrix $Y$ has the structure shown in Equation~\eqref{eq:example:Y:general} with elements
\begin{align*}
 \overline{Y}_{ij}=&-3y_i-0.08x_iy_i\\
 \underline{Y}_{ij}=&-2+0.009x_i-1.2\sum_{k=1}^4 y_k^2+x_k^2.
\end{align*}

\begin{figure*}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:example:Y:general}
		Y=\scalebox{0.75}{$\begin{bmatrix}
			\overline{Y}_{11},&\underline{Y}_{12},&-0.004y_1,&0,&-0.04y_1+0.003x_3y_1,&0.005y_1y_3,&-0.007y_1+0.001x_4y_1,&0\\
			-0.008y_2-0.002x_1y_2,&0,&\overline{Y}_{23},&\underline{Y}_{24},&-0.007y_2-0.004x_3y_2,&0,&-0.04y_2-0.004x_4y_2,&0.005y_2y_4\\
			-0.04y_3-0.004x_1y_3,&0,&-0.008y_3+0.004x_2y_3,&0,&\overline{Y}_{35},&\underline{Y}_{36},&-0.008y_3+0.002x_4y_3,&0\\
			-0.009y_4+0.001x_1y_4,&0,&-0.04-0.003x_2y_4,&0,&-0.004y_4&0,&\overline{Y}_{47},&\underline{Y}_{48}
		\end{bmatrix}$}
\end{equation}
\end{figure*}

In the second case, the constraint imposed on the matrix $Y$ was that each line of this matrix should depend on the system $i$ and on its neighbors. The time taken by the parser to solve the LMI \eqref{eq:LMI formulation} was 98 seconds. The components of the matrix $W$ and the matrix $Y$ that form a solution to the \eqref{eq:LMI formulation} are
\begin{equation*}
		W_a=\mathbin{\mathtt{diag}}\left(
 1.32,1.59\right)\quad\text{and}\quad W_b=\mathbin{\mathtt{diag}}\left(1.08,1.61\right).
\end{equation*}
and the matrix $Y$ has the structure shown in Equation~\eqref{eq:example:Y:neighbor} with elements
\begin{align*}
	Y_{ij}=&-3y_i-0.03x_iy_i&i,j\in\mathbb{N}_{[1,4]}\\
	Y_{12}=&-4-0.01x_1-y_1^2-y_2^2-2x_1^2-x_2^2\\	
	Y_{24}=&-3-0.01x_2-y_1^2-y_2^2-y_3^2-x_1^2-x_2^2-x_3^2\\	
	Y_{36}=&-3-0.01x_3-y_2^2-y_3^2-y_4^2-x_2^2-x_3^2-x_4^2\\	
	Y_{48}=&-4-0.01x_4-y_4^2-y_3^2-2x_4^2-x_3^2
\end{align*}

\begin{figure*}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:example:Y:neighbor}
	Y=\scalebox{0.75}{$\begin{bmatrix}
	Y_{11},&Y_{12},&-0.01y_2+0.03x_2y_1,&0,&0,&0,&0,&0\\
	-0.01y_2-0.002x_1y_2,&0,&Y_{23},&Y_{24},&-0.01y_2+0.03x_3y_2,&0,&0,&0\\
	0,&0,&-0.01y_3+0.03x_2y_3,&0,&Y_{35},&Y_{36},&-0.01y_3-0.002x_4y_3,&0\\
	0,&0,&0,&0,&-0.01y_4+0.03x_3y_4,&0,&Y_{47},&Y_{48}
	\end{bmatrix}$}
\end{equation}
\end{figure*}
 

In the last case, the fully decentralized scenario has been considered. The time taken by the parser to solve the LMI \eqref{eq:LMI formulation} was 101 seconds. In this case, $\mathscr{K}_Y(i)=\{j\in\mathbb{N}_{[1,N]}\setminus\mathscr{K}(i):Y_{ij}\equiv0\}$, where $\mathscr{K}(i)=\{i\}$. Imposing $Y\in\Xi_Y$ and solving the LMI \eqref{eq:LMI formulation} the following matrices were obtained
\begin{align*}
 W=&\mathbin{\mathtt{diag}}\left(W_a,W_b,W_b,W_a\right),\\
 Y=&\mathbin{\mathtt{diag}}\left(Y_1,Y_2,Y_3,Y_4\right)
\end{align*}
where
\begin{equation*}
		W_a=\mathbin{\mathtt{diag}}\left(
 1.43,1.17\right),\quad W_b=\mathbin{\mathtt{diag}}\left(1.03,2.17\right)
\end{equation*}
and, for each index $i\in\mathbb{N}_{[1,4]}$,
\begin{align*}
 Y_i=[-4.33y_i+0.04x_iy_i,\\
 -7.78-&0.01x_i-2.73y_i^2-2.98x_i^2].
\end{align*}

\section{Proof of the Results}\label{sec:Proof of the Results}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:main result}]
	By assumption, the functions $W:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ and $Y:\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^m$ is a solution to the LMI \eqref{eq:LMI formulation}. Apply the coordinate change $\eta=M\delta$ and define the matrices $W=M^{-1}$ and $K=YW^{-1}$. Since $W$ is diagonal, the structure of $Y$ is preserved and, consequently, $K\in\Xi_Y$.
	
	The LMI \eqref{eq:LMI formulation} implies that the inequality
	\begin{equation*}
		\delta_x^\top\bigg(\dot{M}+(A+BK)M+M(A+BK)^\top-2\lambda M\bigg)\delta_x\leq0
	\end{equation*}
	holds, for every $(x,\delta_x,u)\in\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^m$. Consequently, the condition defined by the set of equations \eqref{eq:Arstein-Sontag} holds. Thus, $M$ is a sum-separable control-contraction metric for system \eqref{eq:general system}.
	
	It now remains to integrate $K\delta_x$ to obtain a feedback law for system \eqref{eq:general system} satisfying the constraints of Problem \ref{problem formulation}. Because $M$ is a block-diagonal matrix, the length of any curve $\varphi:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfies the following equation
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:geodesic sum}
		\ell(\varphi)=\int_0^1\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^N \varphi_i'(s_i)^\top M_i(\varphi_i(s_i))\varphi_i'(s_i)}\,ds.
	\end{equation}

	
	Since $M$ is positive definite, the minimum of Equation \eqref{eq:geodesic sum} corresponds to a minimum of each component $i\in\mathbb{N}_{[1,N]}$. More precisely, 
	\begin{equation*}
		\gamma=\arg\inf\ell(\varphi)\Leftrightarrow\gamma_i=\arg\inf e(\varphi_i),\quad\forall i\in\mathbb{N}_{[1,N]}.
	\end{equation*}
	This implies that the minimization of Equation \eqref{eq:geodesic sum} can be computed separately. 
	
	From Hopf-Rinow theorem (cf. \cite[Theorem 7.7]{Boothby1986}), for every index $i\in\mathbb{N}_{[1,N]}$, and for every $x_i$ and $x_i^\ast\in\mathbb{R}^{n_i}$, there exists a solution to the optimization problem
	\begin{align*}
		\gamma_i=\arg\inf_{\varphi_i\in\Gamma(x_i^\ast,x_i)} e(\varphi_i).
	\end{align*}
	This solution is a geodesic smooth curve $\gamma_i:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}^{n_i}$ connecting $x_i$ to $x_i^\ast\in\mathbb{R}^{n_i}$. 
	
	From the definition of the tangent vectors $\delta_x$ and $\delta_u$, given an input $u^\ast$ for system \eqref{eq:general system}, a feedback for system \eqref{eq:general system} that solves item 1 of Problem~\ref{problem formulation} is given by Equation \eqref{eq:contracting feedback law}. 
	
	From the fundamental theorem of calculus, Equation \eqref{eq:contracting feedback law} is equivalent to the differential equation
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:K ODE}
		\frac{dk^\ast}{ds}(t,s)=K(\gamma(s),k^\ast(t,s))\gamma'(s)=:\overline{K}(t,s,k^\ast).
	\end{equation}
	which has a unique solution defined of a maximal interval of existence, for every initial condition, due to the smoothness of the functions $K$ and $\gamma$. It remains to show that this interval of existence can be extended on $[0,1]$. In other words, to show that there exist no $\bar{s}\in[0,1]$ such that $k^\ast(t,s)\to\infty$, as $s\to\bar{s}$.
	
	To show that a solution $k^\ast$ is defined on the whole interval $[0,1]$, the result  \cite[Theorem 2.12]{Teschl2012} is employed. This theorem states that, if the vector field has a linear growth with respect to the variable $k^\ast$, then the solutions to \eqref{eq:K ODE} are defined on the whole interval $[0,1]$.
		
	Since the vector field $\overline{K}$ is smooth, it also Lipschitz. This implies that, for every fixed $t\geq0$, and for every $S>0$, there exists a constants $c_1(S)$ and $c_2(S)$ such that the inequality
	\begin{equation*}
		\left|\overline{K}(t,s,k^\ast)\right|\leq c_1(S)+c_2(S)|k^\ast|
	\end{equation*}
	holds, for every $(s,k^\ast)\in [-S,S]\times\mathbb{R}^m$. Applying \cite[Theorem 2.12]{Teschl2012} pointwisely on $t\geq0$ implies that a solution $k^\ast$ to \eqref{eq:K ODE} is defined for every $s\in[0,1]$.
	
	Note that, due to the structure of the matrix $K$, the feedback law $k^\ast$ defined in Equation \eqref{eq:contracting feedback law} solves item 2 of Problem~\ref{problem formulation}, i.e., $k^\ast\in\Xi$. Furthermore, the computation of a solution to Equation~\eqref{eq:K ODE} can be partially distributed, because each line of the matrix $K$ will depend only on specific components of the vector $\gamma'$.
	
	 This concludes the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:main result}.
\end{proof}


\begin{proof}[Proof of Corollary~\ref{cor:distributed computation}]
	By assumption, the pair of matrices $W$ and $Y$ is a solution to the LMI \eqref{eq:LMI formulation:i} and the matrix $T$ with components defined by the set of equations \eqref{eq:T} is block-diagonally dominant.
	
	Equation \eqref{eq:BDD} together with the fact that $|I_{n_i}|\leq |T_{ii}||T_{ii}^{-1}|$ implies that the inequality
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:BDD2} 
		\sum_{\substack{j=1\\ j\neq i}}^N|T_{ij}|\leq |T_{ii}|
	\end{equation}
	holds, for every index $i\in\mathbb{N}_{[1,N]}$.
	
	For every $\delta_\eta\in\mathbb{R}^n$, consider the product $\delta_\eta^\top T\delta_\eta$. Each line $i\in\mathbb{N}_{[1,N]}$ of this product is given by
	\begin{equation*}
		\delta_{\eta_i}^\top\begin{bmatrix}
			T_{i1}&\cdots&T_{i(i-1)}&T_{ii}&T_{i(i+1)}&\cdots&T_{iN}
		\end{bmatrix}\delta_\eta.
	\end{equation*}
	Inequalities \eqref{eq:BDD2} and \eqref{eq:LMI formulation:i} imply that the inequalities
	\begin{equation*}
		\sum_{\substack{j=1\\ j\neq i}}^N\delta_{\eta_i}^\top T_{ij}\delta_{x_j}\leq \delta_{x_i}^\top T_{ii}\delta_{\eta_i}\leq 0
	\end{equation*}
	hold, for every $\delta_\eta\in\mathbb{R}^n$. Consequently, the inequality $\delta_\eta^\top T\delta_\eta\leq 0$ holds, for every $\delta_\eta\in\mathbb{R}^n$. This later inequality is equivalent to the LMI \eqref{eq:LMI formulation}. This concludes the proof of Corollary~\ref{cor:distributed computation}.
