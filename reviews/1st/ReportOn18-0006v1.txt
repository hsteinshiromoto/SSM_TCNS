The paper has been revised by four independent reviewers. Based on the
feedback received so far and based on the AE's own reading, the
recommendation at this stage is that the paper cannot be accepted.
However, the authors can resubmit their manuscript after the comments
by the reviewers have been carefully addressed.

All the reviewers found the paper clear and well written. However, the
main concerns that have been raised involve:
1. novelty nature of the results - the authors should better clarify
the
novelties of their work and better relate their results with the
literature
2. effectiveness of the results - the authors
should provide some sufficient conditions for the existence of the
sum-separable metric. How this relates to the structure of the graph?
It seems that the matrix inequalities should be satisfied along any
possible (x,u). If this is the case, then this seems to make the
resolution of the inequalities extremely challenging. The authors
should discuss this point.
3. the results of this paper seem to provide a natural extension to
previous works by the authors. What are the benefits of this extension?
Are there cases that cannot be studied with the previous work by the
authors but can be studied with the approach of this paper? 
4. related to the items above, the authors should also include in the
paper a revised application section for e.g. a large scale network
system arising in engineering applications. Platooning of autonomous
vehicles would be, for example, an interesting application. This would
allow the authors to comment on the items raised above.
